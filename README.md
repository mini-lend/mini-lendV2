# MiniLend dApp 🏦

A Simple Crypto-Backed Lending System (Built with Solidity, Foundry, Viem & Anvil)

MiniLend is a decentralized lending application where users can:

✅ Stake ETH as collateral
✅ Borrow a mock USD token (MockUSDT) based on collateral value
✅ Repay borrowed tokens
✅ Withdraw their collateral

This project is designed with **learning and experimentation in mind**, especially for beginners entering the Web3 space.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

### ✅ Foundry (Forge + Anvil)

Foundry is used for:

* Compiling smart contracts
* Running the local blockchain (Anvil)
* Deploying contracts using deployment scripts

Install Foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Reload your terminal:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install components:

```bash
foundryup
```

Verify:

```bash
forge --version
anvil --version
```
❗❗❗ If forge is showing error, it might be using zoe forge library and that is not what we want
run 
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"
```
to change the path and confirm the forge with 
```bash
which forge
```
it should show 
```bash
/.foundry/bin/forge
```

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Start Anvil (Local Blockchain)

Anvil simulates a local Ethereum network with funded accounts.

Run:

```bash
anvil
```

You should see something like:

```
Listening on 127.0.0.1:8545
```

and a list of 10 private keys + addresses funded with 10,000 ETH.

✅ Keep this terminal running
❗ Do NOT close it

---

## 🔑 Step 2: Set Your Private Key

From the Anvil output, copy the first private key:

Example:

```
0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Create a `.env` file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

✅ No quotes
✅ No spaces

---

## 📦 Step 3: Deploy the Contracts

This project contains two contracts:

1. `MockUSDT.sol` – a mintable ERC20 token
2. `MiniLend.sol` – the lending logic

Deployment is done using a Foundry deploy script.

Run:

```bash
source .env
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

If successful, the output will show something like:

```
Deployed MockUSDT at: 0x....
Deployed MiniLend at: 0x....
```

✅ COPY both contract addresses
You will need them in the DApp

---

## 🦊 Step 4: Connect Anvil to MetaMask

Open MetaMask → top network dropdown → Add Network

Click:

**Add network manually**

Enter:

```
Network Name: Anvil
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
Chain ID: 31337
Currency Symbol: ETH
```

Save. (Chrome browser preferable)

---

### ✅ Import a funded account

Click:

MetaMask → Account → Import Account

Paste the same private key from `.env`

Now MetaMask shows:

✅ Local network
✅ 10,000 ETH balance

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Run the DApp Frontend

If your frontend is static:

Open `index.html` in a browser

OR run a simple server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

or

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

---

## 🪝 Step 6: Connect Wallet (IMPORTANT!)

Your dApp **must connect to MetaMask BEFORE loading contracts**

If you load contracts first:

❌ publicClient will not attach properly
❌ walletClient will have no account
❌ calls will fail

So:

1. Open the DApp
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. MetaMask will pop up
4. Accept connection

You should now see something like:

```
Connected: 0x643...345
```

---

## 🧳 Step 7: Load Contract Addresses

Paste:

✅ MiniLend contract address
✅ MockUSDT token address

Then click:

👉 Load Contracts

If successful:

```
Contracts loaded
```

---

## 🧪 Step 8: Test the dApp Features

Now you can interact:

### ✅ Stake ETH

Enter an amount (e.g. 1)

Click:

🟩 Stake

Expected:

* Your staked balance increases
* Contract ETH balance increases

---

### ✅ Borrow USD

Enter amount within LTV limit

Click:

🟨 Borrow

Expected:

* Your mock USDT balance increases
* Contract USDT decreases or mints

---

### ✅ Approve Spending

Before repaying, you must approve MiniLend to spend your USDT

Click:

🟦 Approve

---

### ✅ Repay Loan

Enter amount to repay

Click:

🟥 Repay

---

### ✅ Withdraw ETH

Only works when:

✅ You have fully repaid
✅ You have staked ETH

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| No MetaMask popup    | Not served with HTTP / module import error | Use local server               |
| Cannot load contract | Wallet not connected first                 | Connect wallet before load     |
| Balance shows 0      | Wrong address or wrong chain               | Check Anvil + MetaMask network |
| ABI invalid          | Importing wrong field                      | Use `abi: MiniLendAbi.abi`     |
